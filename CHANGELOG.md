# Changelog

Notable, user-visible changes to `llvmkit`. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); the project is pre-1.0
(`0.0.x`), so breaking changes are expected and are flagged inline. Until a
tagged release is cut, entries accumulate under **Unreleased**.

## [Unreleased]

### Phi guarantees — wave 1

Pushes the *local*, statically- or parse-time-knowable phi invariants into
construction and parsing, so many malformed-phi shapes are rejected before
`Module::verify()` ever runs. Whole-graph facts — dominance and phi-incoming
completeness against the final predecessor set for builder-constructed IR —
remain owned by `Module::verify()` as the final gate (defense in depth).

#### Added

- `IrError::AmbiguousPhiIncoming` — all four phi edge-add paths now reject a
  second incoming for the same predecessor block that carries a *different*
  value. Same-value duplicates stay legal, since a `switch` with several edges
  from one predecessor relies on them. **Stricter:** this conflict was
  previously deferred to `verify()`. In the same change, the untyped
  `phi_add_incoming_from_value` (parser / SSA-builder path) now type-checks the
  incoming value at the call site instead of deferring the type mismatch to
  `verify()`.
- `m_phi()` matcher (binds `PhiKind`), and an InstSimplify fold that rewrites a
  uniform phi — every incoming a single value, self-references permitted — to
  that value.

#### Changed

- **Behavior change:** the six `build_*_phi` builders now insert at the block's
  PHI head regardless of the builder's cursor position, so phi misplacement is
  unrepresentable through the builder (the verifier's `PhiNotAtTop` check stays
  as defense in depth). *Side effect:* the auto-SSA builder's header-phi
  emission order for blocks with two or more header phis changed from
  reverse-creation order to creation order. This is cosmetic — all IR still
  verifies — but any consumer byte-locking auto-SSA output will observe the new
  order.
- **Stricter parsing:** the `.ll` parser now rejects a `phi` that appears after
  a non-phi instruction with the parse error *"phi must be grouped at the top of
  its basic block"*, instead of silently letting the auto-hoisting builder
  reorder ill-formed input.
- **Stricter parsing:** the `.ll` parser now checks phi *completeness* at
  end-of-function parse — once all predecessors are known — and reports
  incomplete or incoherent phis as source-located parse errors. The parser and
  the verifier share one `check_phi_incoming` helper, so parse-time and
  verify-time diagnostics cannot drift apart. Previously these were deferred to
  `verify()`.

#### Fixed

- `FnReshape::split_block` now rewrites successor-block phi incomings as part of
  the split. Previously a correct `ReshapeCfg` pass that split a block with a
  phi successor produced IR that failed `verify()` with `PhiPredecessorMismatch`;
  the split now maintains successor phis itself.

### Phi authoring — block arguments and pass-side edits

A Swift-SIL / MLIR-style block-argument authoring surface where a branch
carries the values for its successor's parameters, so the edge and its phi
incomings move together and can never desync. Plus dominance-witnessed
pass-side phi creation and edge edits that maintain successor phis
mechanically. (Wave-2 additions; the raw phi builders were subsequently made
internal — see "Phi authoring — raw builders internal" below.)

#### Added

- Block-argument authoring: `IRBuilder::append_block_with_params(function,
  &[Type], name)` creates a block whose parameters are operandless head-phis
  and returns the block plus one `Value` per parameter. `build_br_with_args` /
  `build_cond_br_with_args` build the terminator *and* seed each successor
  parameter with the value the branch carries, from the current block —
  arity-checked (`IrError::PhiArgArityMismatch`) and type-checked at the call
  site — those two validations are all-or-nothing (run up front, before any
  incoming is recorded). Printed IR is ordinary phis; storage/parser/printer
  are unchanged.
- `FnReshape::insert_phi(block, ty, incomings)` — pass-side phi creation that
  *witnesses* everything at the call: completeness against the block's
  predecessors, incoming types, differing-duplicate rejection (via the shared
  `check_phi_incoming`), and SSA dominance of each instruction incoming over
  its edge, read from the pass's dominator tree
  (`analysis_repaired::<DominatorTreeAnalysis>`). `IrError::PhiIncomingNotDominating`
  on a dominance failure.
- `FnReshape::remove_edge` / `redirect_edge` drop or retarget a CFG edge and
  mechanically maintain the affected
  successors' phis as part of the op — `remove_edge` drops the predecessor's
  incomings, `redirect_edge` takes the new target's per-parameter values as a
  required, type-checked argument, so "forgot the target's phis" cannot occur.
  Both record `CfgUpdate`s for the analysis-preservation machinery.

#### Changed

- **Wider parsing:** the `.ll` parser now accepts vector and aggregate phi
  result types (`phi <4 x i32>`, `phi {i32, i8}`) — previously rejected as
  "must be int, float, or pointer". Non-data first-class types (`label`,
  `metadata`, `token`) are still rejected, so no invalid IR slips through.

### Phi authoring — raw builders internal (breaking)

Completes the block-argument transition: block arguments are now the *only*
public way to author a phi, so an incomplete or predecessor-desynced phi is
unrepresentable through the public API rather than merely rejected at
`Module::verify()`.

#### Added

- `IRBuilder::append_block_with_named_params(function, &[(Type, &str)], name)`
  names each block parameter's head-phi, so block-argument authoring reproduces
  named-phi output byte-for-byte (e.g. the hand-written factorial's `%acc`/`%i`
  loop-header phis, which keep byte-parity with the auto-SSA factorial).

#### Changed

- **Breaking:** the three marker-form builders `IRBuilder::build_int_phi` /
  `build_fp_phi` / `build_pointer_phi` and the `PhiInst` / `FpPhiInst` /
  `PointerPhiInst` open-phi `add_incoming` / `finish` mutators are no longer
  public (`pub(crate)`). (The runtime-typed `build_int_phi_dyn` /
  `build_fp_phi_dyn` / `build_pointer_phi_in_addrspace` forms and the untyped
  `phi_add_incoming_from_value` stay reachable, but only as `#[doc(hidden)]`
  internal-contract items for the `.ll` parser — not supported public API.)
  Author phis with block arguments instead — the edge and its incomings move
  together, so desync is unrepresentable rather than deferred to `verify()`:

  | Was (no longer public) | Now (public) |
  | --- | --- |
  | `let p = b.build_int_phi::<i32, _>("p")?;` then `p.add_incoming(v0, pred0)?.add_incoming(v1, pred1)?;` | `let (blk, params) = b.append_block_with_params(f, &[i32_ty], "join")?;` then from each predecessor `b.build_br_with_args(blk.label(), &[v])?;`; the phi is `params[0]` |
  | naming the phi: `build_int_phi::<i32, _>("acc")` | `append_block_with_named_params(f, &[(i32_ty, "acc")], "join")` |
  | pass-side phi creation | `FnReshape::insert_phi(block, ty, incomings)` (unchanged) |

  The read surface (`PhiKind`, `incoming`, `incoming_count`, the `m_phi`
  matcher) is unchanged, and the `.ll` parser is unaffected (it reaches the
  builders through `#[doc(hidden)]` internal-contract entry points). The phi
  storage, printer, and verifier are unchanged — printed IR is still ordinary
  phis.

### Phi — verifier result-type rule and branch edge ops

The last two deferred phi-authoring items.

#### Added

- `VerifierRule::PhiInvalidResultType` — `Module::verify()` now rejects a phi
  whose *result* type is not a first-class **data** type (int, float, pointer —
  the opaque `ptr` and the legacy typed `i32*` — vector, array, non-opaque
  struct). Previously only the `.ll` parser enforced this, so a phi with a
  `token` / `label` / `metadata` / `void` result built through another path (the
  internal erased phi builders take an arbitrary `Type`) verified clean. Defense
  in depth: the guarantee now holds regardless of construction path. **Stricter
  `verify()`**, though only for IR that was already invalid. `VerifierRule` is
  `#[non_exhaustive]`, so the new variant is not a breaking change. Adds
  `Type::is_typed_pointer` alongside `Type::is_pointer` (which matches only the
  opaque `ptr`).
- `FnReshape::remove_edge` / `redirect_edge` now operate on **`br` and `cond_br`**,
  not just `switch`. `redirect_edge` retargets the unconditional `br` target or
  the matching arm of a `cond_br`; `remove_edge` collapses a `cond_br` to
  `br <surviving>` when one of its two edges is dropped, deregistering the
  now-dead condition operand. `BranchInstData.kind` became interior-mutable (a
  `RefCell<BranchKind>`, mirroring `SwitchInstData`'s `Cell`/`RefCell`), so the
  reshape mutator — which reaches instructions only through the arena's shared
  `&ValueData` — can edit branch targets and the branch *kind*. Removing the sole
  edge of an unconditional `br` is rejected (no successor would remain).
  `invoke`/`callbr` edges remain uneditable — see `docs/future-work.md`.

#### Changed

- **Stricter parsing:** the `.ll` parser now rejects a phi whose result type is
  an **opaque struct** (`phi %opaque`). It previously accepted it — contradicting
  its own comment — and produced IR that then failed `Module::verify()`. The
  parser and the verifier now accept exactly the same set of phi result types.

#### Fixed

- `FnReshape::remove_edge` / `redirect_edge` no longer leave a **zero-incoming
  phi** behind. When the removed edge was a block's *only* incoming edge, its
  head phis lost their last incoming and were left as `%p = phi i32` with no
  `[ … ]` pairs — a form LLVM's own LL parser rejects, so the module no longer
  round-tripped (even though `Module::verify()` accepted it, the count matching
  a now-zero-predecessor block). Both ops now mirror LLVM
  `BasicBlock::removePredecessor`: an emptied phi is replaced with poison (of
  its own result type) and erased, so the result round-trips. (A companion
  *defensive* verifier rule — a phi in a reachable block must carry at least one
  incoming — is tracked separately in `docs/future-work.md`.)

### Phi — zero-incoming verifier backstop

The companion defensive verifier rule to the round-trip fix above.

#### Added

- `VerifierRule::PhiEmptyInReachableBlock` — `Module::verify()` now rejects a
  phi that carries **zero** incoming values in a block **reachable from entry**,
  however the phi arose. Such a phi prints as `%p = phi i32` with no `[ … ]`
  pairs — a form `LLParser::parsePHI` rejects, so the module no longer
  round-trips. The shared `check_phi_incoming` count guard misses this: a
  zero-incoming phi in a zero-predecessor block passes on `0 == 0` (the same gap
  LLVM's `Verifier::visitPHINode` shares). The new check runs before that
  delegation and gates on `DominatorTree::is_reachable_from_entry` — an
  unreachable block may legitimately have no predecessors, so its phis are not
  forced to carry incomings. The public mutation path (the typed edge-edit ops —
  see the breaking entry below) already erases such phis; this backstop catches
  any other construction path. **Stricter `verify()`**, though only for IR that
  has no
  legal textual form. `VerifierRule` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so the new variant
  is not a breaking change.

### Phi — typed terminator edit surface (breaking)

Replaces the dynamic CFG-edge ops with a typed edit surface whose method set
encodes which edits are legal, so a structurally-invalid edge edit is a compile
error instead of a runtime rejection. Same single-validated phi/edge maintenance
underneath.

#### Added

- `FnReshape::edit_terminator(from)` narrows a block's terminator into a typed
  edit handle whose *type* fixes the legal edge ops, plus the `dyn_cast`-style
  narrows `edit_switch` / `edit_cond_br` / `edit_br` / `edit_invoke` /
  `edit_callbr`:
  - `SwitchEdit`: `redirect_successor` / `redirect_default` / `remove_successor`
  - `CondBrEdit`: `redirect_then` / `redirect_else` / `remove_then` / `remove_else`
  - `BrEdit`: `redirect`
  - `InvokeEdit`: `redirect_normal` / `redirect_unwind`
  - `CallBrEdit`: `redirect_default` / `redirect_indirect`

  `edit_terminator` returns the `TermEdit` enum (with an `Uneditable` arm for
  `ret` / `unreachable` / `indirectbr` and the EH terminators). Each op runs
  through the same single-validated path as before: successor phis are maintained
  mechanically, and an emptied phi is poison-erased for LLVM `removePredecessor`
  parity.
- First-class `invoke` / `callbr` edge redirects (`redirect_normal` /
  `redirect_unwind`, `redirect_default` / `redirect_indirect`) retarget those
  mandatory successor edges in place — the last deferred phi follow-up, now
  shipped.

#### Removed

- **Breaking:** the dynamic `FnReshape::remove_edge` / `redirect_edge` are gone;
  use the typed narrows above. The migration is mechanical:
  `remove_edge(from, to)` → `edit_switch(&from)?.remove_successor(&to)` (switch)
  or `edit_cond_br(&from)?.remove_then()` / `.remove_else()` (cond_br, pick the
  arm whose target is `to`); `redirect_edge(from, old, new, vals)` →
  `edit_switch(&from)?.redirect_successor(&old, &new, vals)` /
  `.redirect_default(&new, vals)` (switch),
  `edit_cond_br(&from)?.redirect_then` / `.redirect_else(&new, vals)` (cond_br),
  or `edit_br(&from)?.redirect(&new, vals)` (unconditional `br`).

#### Changed

- **Structurally-invalid edge edits are now compile errors, not runtime
  rejections.** Removing an `invoke` / `callbr` edge, the sole edge of an
  unconditional `br`, or a `switch` default is unspellable — the method simply
  does not exist on the corresponding handle (`E0599`). A second `cond_br`
  collapse is a use-after-move, since `remove_then` / `remove_else` consume the
  handle (`E0382`).
- **Semantic change:** collapsing a `cond_br` whose *both* arms target the same
  block is now valid. The old `remove_edge` rejected it as ambiguous; the
  role-named `remove_then` / `remove_else` name the arm, so the collapse to
  `br <survivor>` is unambiguous.

### Const-generic vector and array types (breaking)

Fixed vectors and arrays now carry their **element type** and **length** in the
Rust type system, so `<N x T>` / `[N x T]` length mismatches and wrong-element
`insertelement` / `insertvalue` — previously caught only by `Module::verify()` —
become **compile errors**. This is the vector/array analog of the scalar
`IntValue<'ctx, W: IntWidth, B>`. Erased (`Dyn`) markers are the defaults, so a
bare `VectorValue<'ctx>` / `ArrayValue<'ctx>` is the fully-erased form, and
parsed `.ll`, scalable vectors, and runtime lengths land there unchanged.

#### Added

- Element markers `VecElem` (base) and `StaticVecElem<'ctx, B>` (projection) in
  `element.rs`, spelled by the scalar markers themselves (`i64`, `f64`, `bool`,
  the int-width and float-kind markers); `ElemDyn` is the erased element.
- Length markers `Len<const N: u32>` / `LenDyn` (+ `StaticVecLen`) for vectors
  and `ArrLen<const N: u64>` / `ArrLenDyn` (+ `StaticArrayLen`) for arrays —
  separate families because vector lengths are `u32` and array lengths `u64`.
- Const-generic constructors `Module::vector_type_n::<E, const N: u32>()` and
  `array_type_n::<E, const N: u64>()`. `vector_type_n` rejects `N == 0` at
  monomorphisation (a `const {}` assert); `[0 x T]` arrays stay legal.
- Typed value narrowing — `TryFrom<Value>` for `VectorValue<E, Len<N>>` and
  `ArrayValue<E, ArrLen<N>>` checks element **and** length before stamping the
  markers (`OperandWidthMismatch` / `IrError::ArrayLengthMismatch` for length,
  `TypeMismatch` for element), mirroring the scalar `IntValue` narrowing.
- Typed op builders that lower into the existing erased builders (byte-identical
  IR): `build_vec_int_{add,sub,mul,xor,and,or,shl,lshr,ashr}` (both operands
  pinned to the same `E`,`N`, so a length/element mismatch has no matching impl),
  `build_vec_extract` / `build_vec_insert` / `build_vec_splat`, and the array
  `build_arr_extract` / `build_arr_insert`. `build_alloca` accepts a typed array
  type directly (its result stays an erased `PointerValue`).
- `IrError::ArrayLengthMismatch { expected: u64, got: u64 }` — a statically
  lengthed array handle narrowed from an array of a different length.
- `WrapWitness` — an unforgeable in-crate token gating `StaticVecElem::wrap_value`
  (the sole unchecked `Value` → typed-scalar-handle wrap) to callers that already
  hold an element-type proof; every external `Value` → typed-handle path stays the
  checked `TryFrom`.
- Example `crates/llvmkit-ir/examples/typed_vector_array.rs` and three new table
  rows in `docs/type-safety-vs-llvm.md`.

#### Changed

- **Breaking:** `VectorType` / `VectorValue` and `ArrayType` / `ArrayValue` each
  gained two defaulted generic parameters — element and length. The bare handles
  (`VectorValue<'ctx>`, `ArrayType<'ctx>`, …) still name the fully-erased form and
  behave exactly as before; only code that spelled these handles with an explicit
  brand-only generic list must now also spell the `Dyn` markers.
- **Breaking:** the unwired element-as-type-handle scaffolds `VectorElement` /
  `SizedElement` (`vector_element.rs` / `sized_element.rs`) are removed, replaced
  by the scalar-marker `VecElem` / `ElemDyn` in `element.rs`. They had no
  consumers.

Still erased by design (runtime/verifier-checked, unchanged): scalable vectors,
pointer-element vectors (blocked on address-space markers), composite-element
arrays, and length-relating ops (`shufflevector` output length, concat `N1+N2`,
compile-time index-in-bounds) that need `generic_const_exprs` on nightly. See
`docs/future-work.md`.
